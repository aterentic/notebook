[Europa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101829/)

> In the morning, the sleeper has found rest on the bottom of the river. The force of the stream has opened the door and is leading you on. Above your body, people are still alive. Follow the river as days go by. Head for the ocean that mirrors the sky. You want to wake up to free yourself of the image of Europa. But it is not possible...

> This system make of us slaves. Without dignity. WIthout depth. With a devil in our pocket. This, this incredible money are in the pocket. This money. This shit. This nothing. This paper who have nothing inside. Movies have heart. Boom-boom-boom. Have mind. Have power. Have ambition. I wanted to do something like that. Why not?

> We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction...

[Gabi Sultana - DM City Gent](https://www.gabisultana.com/dm-city-gent-interview)

> As a teenager I was very influenced by Aphex Twin. Nowadays my list of current favorite electronic artists would have to include Alva Noto, Autechre and Sendai (Peter Van Hoesen and Yves De Mey). There are many reasons why I pick these three , but the common factor is their detail in sound. I find that fascinating. And I should also mention Shackleton because of his unique and recognizable sound. ```

[The art of DJing: Jane Fitz](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3296)

> When I hear a record, I still get so excited by a particular sound. There will be a bit in a record, it could be a drum break or a synth sound or an arp, it could be space in the record, there will be that one bit of every record where I'm like, "Yesss!!!" And when you're having that moment, and you can see someone else having the exact same response to the same part of the record that you are... You're so excited! It's this confirmation that you are having a connection with people, and you can read their mind and they can read your mind... I don't know what it is, it's just a buzz. Having that instant connection about some weird bit in a record, that's the thing that drives everything, it's like, "Wow, you really heard what I heard, that's so nice, because I'm really excited by this, and it's so nice that somebody else is really excited by this as well." Then I feel like I've done my job. You hear what I hear.
